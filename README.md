# 🏠🏞 Indoor/Outdoor Image Classification

This project contains a Python script for classifying images as either "indoor" or "outdoor" scenes using a pre-trained CLIP model and a lightweight few-shot, prototype-based method. It was built in response to a practical classification task using real-world, unlabeled image data.

---

## 📦 Description

The classifier leverages **OpenAI’s CLIP (`clip-vit-base-patch32`)** as a visual encoder and classifies new images by comparing their embeddings to **representative class prototypes** created from a small set of hand-picked example images (few-shot learning).

It is:

* **Training-free** (no fine-tuning needed)
* **Fast**, with support for CPU
* **Modular**, and easy to improve further

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* PyTorch
* HuggingFace Transformers
* Pillow
* tqdm

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision transformers pillow tqdm
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Prepare Your Directory

Your project structure should look like this:

```

few_shot/
├── inside/         # 14 indoor example images
└── outside/        # 56 outdoor example images
unlabeled/          # images to classify
classified/
├── inside/
└── outside/
```

### 2. Run the Script

```bash
python classify.py --unlabeled_folder ./unlabeled
```

All images will be sorted into `classified/inside/` or `classified/outside/`.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

### ✔ Model

* Used `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32` from HuggingFace.
* Embeddings are extracted for both:

  * **Text prompts** (e.g. “a photo taken indoors”)
  * **Few-shot example images**

### ✔ Classification Logic

* For each input image:

  1. Get its CLIP embedding.
  2. Compute similarity with the **averaged prompt embeddings** and **few-shot image embeddings** for both classes.
  3. Predict the label based on which class is most similar.
  4. Copy the image into `classified/inside` or `classified/outside`.

## 🧪 Observations & Insights

### ✅ Strengths

* **No model training required**.
* Uses **semantic understanding** of CLIP to generalize well from very few examples.
* Classification is fast and explainable via embedding similarity.

### ⚠️ Limitations & Edge Cases

| Category                      | Example                             | Insight                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ambiguous scenes**          | `190881191_*.jpg`                   | Difficult even for humans — may require a third “uncertain” class.                           |
| **Roofed or car interiors**   | `219636488_*.jpg`, `70939958_*.jpg` | Hard to classify without additional context. A metadata-aware system could help.             |
| **Clear misclassifications**  | `79869777_*.jpg`, `227589596_*.jpg` | These suggest potential for integrating a secondary model (e.g., object or scene detection). |
| **Unexplainable predictions** | `253900795_*.jpg`                   | Using tools like SHAP or Grad-CAM could help analyze model behavior.                         |
| **Prompt sensitivity**        | `50587842_*.jpg`, `56540294_*.jpg`  | Prompt phrasing impacts performance. Dataset-specific tuning may be necessary.               |
| **Environmental cues**        | `99454779_*.jpg`                    | CLIP may misinterpret light, shadow, or dominant color tones without grounding.              |

## 💡 What I'd Improve with More Time

1. **Scene-based Inference Engine**
   Integrate a secondary model like **Places365** to handle hard or misclassified cases via scene labels (e.g., “sky”, “room”, “forest”).

2. **Confidence Thresholding + Review Bucket**
   Use cosine margin between top class scores to route ambiguous images to a separate `review/` folder.

3. **Explainability Tools**
   Integrate **SHAP** or **Grad-CAM** for analyzing misclassifications and model confidence.

4. **Prompt Augmentation**
   Dynamically optimize prompts using prompt ensembling or prompt tuning strategies.

5. **Logistic Regression Head (Optional)**
   For larger datasets (\~100+ labeled examples), train a simple linear classifier on top of embeddings for potentially improved boundaries.
